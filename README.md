This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: accessing elements outside the bounds of a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version using safe access methods.  This example highlights the importance of robust bounds checking when working with dynamic arrays in C++ to prevent undefined behavior and potential crashes.
